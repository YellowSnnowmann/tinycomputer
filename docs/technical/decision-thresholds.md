# Decision thresholds

Every constant a flow decision is thresholded on, with its value and where it
lives. [`decision-loops.md`](decision-loops.md) explains each loop;
[`specs/jev-wide-turns.md`](specs/jev-wide-turns.md) the wide strategy's.
Change a constant and its row together.

| Constant | Value | Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DONE` | 0.75 | `act/mod.rs` | completion that ends a step after acting; also the bar for `verify`, `wait_for`, `if`, `repeat_until` |
| `ALREADY_DONE` | 0.85 | `act/mod.rs` | completion that skips a step before acting |
| `BLOCKED` | 0.70 | `act/mod.rs` | obstacle probability that triggers dismissal |
| `LEANS_DONE` | 0.50 | `act/mod.rs` | completion under which a `finished` move is overruled after acting |
| `REGRESSION` | 0.25 | `act/mod.rs` | progress drop that triggers undo |
| `UNHELPFUL` | 0.20 | `act/mod.rs` | `helped` probability that triggers undo |
| `SHORTCUT_FLOOR` | 0.50 | `act/mod.rs` | least probability for pressing a shortcut |
| `ACT` | 0.70 | `view/mod.rs` | element choice used without re-asking |
| `NAMED_FLOOR` | 0.45 | `ground/mod.rs` | element choice used when its name is in the purpose |
| `CORROBORATED` | 0.80 | `ground/mod.rs` | corroboration that accepts a target alone |
| `AGREED` | 0.50 | `ground/mod.rs` | corroboration that accepts a target the re-ask agreed on |
| `SLOT_FLOOR` | 0.40 | `enter/mod.rs` | least probability for a slot assignment |
| `LOCATE_FLOOR` | 0.50 | `steps/mod.rs` | least probability for a `read`, `pick`, or `stop_before` target, an `extract`'s list, or a ranked card belonging to the list a `pick` picks from |
| `RANKED_CHECKS` | 8 | `steps/mod.rs` | cards an exact `pick` ranking puts first that are asked about, at once, for the first that belongs to the list picked from |
| `MAX_LISTS` | 6 | `steps/mod.rs` | lists an `extract` offers Jev when several show; past it, the longest six |
| `LIST_PREVIEW` | 3 | `steps/mod.rs` | first items of each list an `extract` shows Jev to tell the lists apart |
| `MAX_COLLECTED` | 12 | `wide/mod.rs` | saved variables every state recalls as `already_collected`, the most recent first kept |
| `COLLECTED_CHARS` | 120 | `wide/mod.rs` | characters of each saved value `already_collected` recalls |
| `MIN_FLAT_ITEMS` | 3 | `tinycomputer-core` `surface/groups.rs` | same-role leaf siblings that make a list for `extract` and `pick` on a screen where nothing repeats by ordinal, as on a desktop tree |
| `CAP` | 20 | `ask/mod.rs` | most options in one Choice |
| `HEDGED` | 0.10 | `ask/answers.rs` | distance from an even chance within which a condition's calibrated yes/no says nothing either way, and defers to a crisp coverage |
| `CRISP_TOP` | 0.85 | `ask/answers.rs` | probability on a condition's top coverage level at which it stands alone for a hedged yes/no |
| `DO_TURNS` | 8 | `steps/mod.rs` | turns a `do` step may spend |
| `REFLECT_FLOOR` | 0.50 | `reflect.rs` | belief that a pressed `choose` left its choice, below which it is repaired, and failed if the repair does not take |
| `REPAIR_TURNS` | 4 | `reflect.rs` | turns one reflection repair may spend |
| `MAX_ACTIONS` / `MAX_CALLS` | 120 / 10000 | `mod.rs` | per-run caps on actions and Jev calls |
| `MAX_VOTES` | 9 | `vote.rs` | most framings one decision is asked in; a deliberated decision is widened up to it |
| `STALL_TURNS` / `MAX_IDLE_WAITS` | 3 / 2 | `act/mod.rs` | unchanged turns before a step fails; idle waits before Jev may not wait again |
| `MAX_OBSTACLES` / `MAX_UNDOS` | 2 / 2 | `act/mod.rs` | obstacles dismissed and undos run per step at most |
| `FIELD_ERROR` | 0.70 | `enter/mod.rs` | field-error probability that makes a slot be entered again |
| `NOT_ASKED` | 0.35 | `enter/mod.rs` | "the form asks for it" probability under which a slot with no field is taken as not asked for |
| `BLIND_PICK_MISSES` | 1 | `enter/mod.rs` | details no picker offered, on a screen with no editable field, after which the rest are not looked for one by one and the step fails |
| `EMPTY_CHECKS` | 2 | `steps/mod.rs` | checks in a row, a wait apart, on which a page says it found nothing (`FOUND_NOTHING` in `steps/condition.rs`) before a `wait_for` fails |
| `SUGGESTION_FLOOR` | 0.5 | `steps/suggestion.rs` | least probability a suggestion Jev picks after typing needs before it is pressed; under it the text stays as typed |
| `MOST_SUGGESTIONS` | 12 | `steps/suggestion.rs` | most new rows one pick of an autocomplete's suggestion is asked over |
| `OPTION_EXTRA_WORDS` | 12 | `steps/matching.rs` | words beyond an option's own that a label may carry and still be the option; a label longer than that lists more than the option (a panel naming every row) and is not pressed for it |

## Deliberation

The gates of [`specs/jev-deliberation.md`](specs/jev-deliberation.md), which

`deliberation` is `off`.

| `MAX_DEPTH` | 10 | `tinycomputer-core` `surface/digest/` | deepest ancestor level regions are split on |
| `LIST_CARDS` | 12 | `tinycomputer-core` `surface/digest/` | cards of a list shown one line each before the rest are counted |
| `CARD_CHARS` | 160 | `tinycomputer-core` `surface/digest/` | longest a card's line is let to run |

//! Sight: a web page read the way a person looks at it, rather than
//! through its accessibility tree.
//!
//! The accessibility tree says what a page *declares*: roles and names from
//! ARIA and label markup, which most sites apply partly or wrongly. A list of
//! cities marked `combobox` with a label that points nowhere, an icon button
//! with no name, a field labelled only by the words printed above it — the
//! tree leaves each of these unnamed or mislabelled, and a flow cannot tell
//! them apart. A person never reads the markup. They see what is drawn and
//! what is on top, read the words on a control or beside a box, and know a
//! box takes text because it has a caret.
//!
//! `sight.js` does the same in one pass over the rendered page, run through
//! the engine's `evaluate`:
//!
//! - **What counts as a control** is decided by behaviour: native controls,
//!   elements that show a pointer cursor or take focus, and ARIA roles — but
//!   a "text box" that takes no text is a button to press, and one that only
//!   wraps a real input is read as that input. A date picker's calendar (a
//!   table of day numbers under its month and year) offers each enabled day
//!   as a `gridcell` described by the date it stands for, though many
//!   pickers show a pointer on a day only under the mouse, and its arrows
//!   read as "next month" and "previous month".
//! - **Only what is drawn** is kept: no zero-size, hidden, or transparent
//!   elements. An element outside the viewport is `offscreen`; one whose
//!   middle is under something else is `covered` (not when the cover is the
//!   same result card's own text).
//! - **Names are the words a person reads:** the text on the control; for a
//!   field, its tied label, then the page's label for it, then the words
//!   beside or above it, then its placeholder; for a picture-only control,
//!   its alternative text, then the icon's class words (`close`, `search`),
//!   then, for a link, where it leads.
//! - **Two elements drawn as one control are one control:** the same box,
//!   a wrapper with the same words, or a page's own radio drawn next to the
//!   real one in the same label.
//! - **Containers are what a person sees a control in:** dialogs and fixed
//!   layers, landmarks, named sections, and the cards of a list with their
//!   ordinal, so result cards group as they do from the tree.

//! - **Noise is left out:** ads (frames and links to ad servers, blocks
//!   named or labelled as ads, tracking pixels), blank clickable boxes, and
//!   what the page hides from people (`inert`, clipped screen-reader text,
//!   and `aria-hidden` content slid out sideways or behind a dialog). An ad
//!   in front, and a cookie, consent, or newsletter banner, is never noise:
//!   a person has to answer it. The reply's `denoised` counts what went, by
//!   kind ([`Denoised`]).
//!
//! Each control is marked with a `data-tc-seen` attribute the first time it
//! is seen, and keeps it for as long as the element lives: a ref
//! (`seen:12`) is that attribute's CSS selector, so an element a page
//! removes or replaces leaves its ref pointing at nothing, and acting on it
//! fails rather than reaching whatever took its place.
//!
//! What a CSS selector from the page cannot address is read through the
//! tree. A shadow root that shows controls (even one whose host draws no
//! box of its own) has its host's subtree read by the tree and merged into
//! the reading, under the label of the layer it draws; sight gives way to
//! the tree for the whole page when two shadow roots show controls, or a
//! large frame is in front.

//! [`BrowserSurface`]: one browser session as a decision loop's
//! [`Surface`], so the flow runtime drives a web page the way it drives a
//! desktop application.
//!
//! Surface calls block, and the flow runtime makes them off its executor
//! (`spawn_blocking`); each one here runs the async [`Browser`] call to
//! completion on the runtime handle the surface was built with. The session
//! opens lazily, on the first call that needs a page.
//!
//! When the session has a window on screen, the agent's cursor glides onto
//! each element before the surface acts on it (`cursor.rs`). It is cosmetic:
//! the actions are the same with or without it.

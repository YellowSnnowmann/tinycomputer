//! The task controller behind the Agent interface.
//!
//! [`Tasks`] takes a task — a flow and the facts it may type — runs it in
//! the background, and reports it as a [`TaskView`] a model can act on. It
//! pauses only for what the caller must decide:
//!
//! - **missing values** — a `${name}` the flow uses and no fact supplies
//!   becomes `needs_input` before anything runs;
//! - **irreversible actions** — a `stop_before` the task may not perform
//!   becomes `needs_approval`, and approving it performs that action and
//!   carries on with the steps after it;
//! - **payment** — the control that pays is never pressed on its own: by
//!   default reaching it is a final checkpoint, and under
//!   [`PaymentMode::FillThenApprove`] the payment form is filled and pressing
//!   it waits for `needs_approval`.
//!
//! - **a failed step** — when a rescuer is configured, a step that fails is
//!   first handed to it ([`crate::Rescuer`]), up to five times a task: its
//!   steps run in place of the failed one and the task carries on. Only when
//!   it gives up, or the rescues are spent, does the task fail.
//!
//! Facts reach the flow as variables, so they are typed locally. Shared ones
//! also brief Jev by value ([`FlowBrief`]); secret ones reach Jev only as
//! `${name}`. The flow runs with `include_values` on, so Jev reads what a
//! field holds and can check what was typed; the flow runtime masks every
//! secret value, there too, before anything reaches Jev. Every summary is
//! redacted of every fact.
//!
//! How a flow actually runs is behind [`FlowRunner`], so this controller is
//! tested with scripted runs and the module plugs in the real flow runtime.
//!
//! The controller's API is in `controller`; each task's cell and state in
//! `store`; the background run in `drive`, capped by `budget` and briefed by
//! `brief`; answering a paused task in `resume`; rescuing a failed step in
//! `recovery`; spotting a wall only a person can pass in `human`; and what
//! the caller sees in `publish`; the screenshots a stopped run leaves in
//! `artifact`.

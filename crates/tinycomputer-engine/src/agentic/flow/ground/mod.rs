//! Picking one element for a purpose, with as few and as small questions as
//! the screen allows.
//!
//! 1. **Memory**: an element that grounded the same step before is offered
//!    first and confirmed with one yes/no question.
//! 2. **Narrowing**: a pool larger than [`CAP`] is split by region (the
//!    ancestor it sits under). One round trip asks which region holds the
//!    element and a knockout of `CAP`-sized groups cut along the regions;
//!    the chosen region's winners go on to the Choice.
//! 3. **Choice** over at most `CAP` elements.
//! 4. **Consistency and corroboration**: a low-confidence pick is re-asked
//!    with relabelled options, and confirmed with a yes/no question, in one
//!    request. It is used only if the evidence agrees.
//!
//! A deliberating run (`docs/technical/specs/jev-deliberation.md`) changes three
//! things. The pool is denoised first (`denoise/`): what is in view ranks
//! ahead of what is not. Narrowing keeps the two best regions wherever the
//! region answer is close — an early wrong branch is the one grounding can
//! never recover from — and at the deep level, when the region answer left
//! group winners out, the final Choice is asked a second time over every
//! winner, to cross-check the region against a pick that never used it. And
//! step 4 gives way to the evidence gate and its escalation ladder
//! (`escalate`).
//!
//! The first round is built by [`FlowRun::opening`](super::FlowRun::opening) without being asked, so
//! a `do` turn can send it with its judge, and finished by
//! [`FlowRun::resume`](super::FlowRun::resume).
//!
//! `narrow` holds memory, the opening round, and region narrowing;
//! `decide` holds the final Choice and its re-asks.

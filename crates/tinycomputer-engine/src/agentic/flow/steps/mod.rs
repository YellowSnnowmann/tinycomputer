//! - `launch`: `open` and `browse`.
//! - `condition`: `verify`, `wait_for`, `repeat_until`, and `if`, all built
//!   on judging one condition (`holds`).
//! - `choose` and `reveal`: `choose`, and the ways it makes a missing option
//!   show.
//! - `read`, `list`, and `stop`: `read`; `pick` and `extract`; `stop_before`.
//! - `date` and `matching`: the pure rules for reading a date option and
//!   matching an option to the controls on screen.

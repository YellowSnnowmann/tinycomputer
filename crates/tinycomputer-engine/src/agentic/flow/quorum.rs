//! Ending a decision on a quorum: once all but its last two framings have
//! answered, and agree so plainly that the last two almost never change
//! what the loops or the evidence gate make of the answers, the decision is
//! merged without waiting for them.
//!
//! A decision waits for its slowest framing. Replayed over 13,669 decisions
//! asked seven ways, from 245 live runs, a quorum of five ended 12% of them,
//! a median 0.14 s before the seventh answer and about 2 s a run, and every
//! one read the same on every threshold, choice floor, and evidence gate as
//! all seven framings did, but for two whose mean moved by under 0.002 across
//! the edge of the evidence band. A quorum of four agreed with all seven only
//! 99.2% of the time: its stragglers dissented.
//!
//! The framings left are not cancelled: each runs to its end, its exchange
//! journaled, so its connection goes back to the pool for the next decision.

//! The escalation ladder: what a deliberating decision asks before it acts.
//!
//! When the evidence behind an answer is thin (`evidence/`), the decision
//! climbs, one rung at a time, and stops at the first rung that settles it:
//!
//! 1. **More framings** (`widen`): the same request asked the ways it was
//!    not yet asked, up to [`vote::MAX_VOTES`](super::vote::MAX_VOTES), every answer joining the
//!    question's ballot.
//! 2. **A duel** (`duel/`): the finalists of a target Choice compared two
//!    at a time, in both orders.
//! 3. **Contrast** (deep only, when the duel named no champion): the two
//!    leaders each asked "is this the element?" beside "is this only
//!    something similar or next to it?".
//!
//! A close call no rung settles is still acted on, at its best ranking, with
//! the runners-up kept for a backtrack: deliberation changes picks, and
//! refuses one only when the evidence says nothing on screen serves.
//! 4. **Views** (deep only, a judgement that would pass): a yes/no asked again over other
//!    renderings of the screen — the screen alone, without the history that
//!    can lead it, and what changed since the step began. The readings are
//!    combined by their median, so one dissenting view neither passes nor
//!    vetoes a judgement: the screen alone cannot show that a radio already
//!    selected was selected by this step, and must not overrule the views
//!    that can.
//!
//! Every rung is one `FlowRun::ask`, so the budget, masking, voting, and
//! journal all apply, and every rung first checks the budget has room: a
//! run short of calls stops climbing and decides with what it has, rather
//! than failing for lack of deliberation.
//!
//! `belief` climbs the ladder for a yes/no judgement, and `target` for a
//! target Choice.

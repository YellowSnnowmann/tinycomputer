//! The loop behind a `do` step: judge, choose a move, act, judge again.
//!
//! Every turn asks one request about the current screen: whether the step is
//! already accomplished (completion), how far along it is (progress), whether
//! something unrelated is in the way (obstacles), and which app-agnostic move
//! to make next (moves). Only an `activate`, `expand`, or `scroll` move needs
//! an element, and that is grounded separately with the narrowing loops.
//!
//! The moves are generic on purpose: a flow names no UI, so the next move is
//! picked from things every application offers — pressing a visible control,
//! a standard shortcut, scrolling, waiting.
//!
//! A deliberating run (`docs/technical/specs/jev-deliberation.md`) adds a loop around
//! every press. Before it, the press's effect is predicted (`expect/`) and
//! a checkpoint taken (`checkpoint/`); after it, the effect is checked, and
//! when the screen contradicts it the next judgement asks whether the press
//! did what it was meant to. A mistake is undone back to the checkpoint —
//! verified — and the next-best
//! candidate grounding ranked is tried before grounding again. A judgement
//! of "done" near its threshold is settled on its evidence (`escalate`), and
//! a screen that returns to where it was two turns ago bans both presses.
//!
//! The loop's pieces: `turns` runs it, `judge` reads each turn's screen,
//! `moves` makes the chosen move, and `recover` undoes a turn that went
//! wrong. This root holds the thresholds and the state they share.

//! The optional planner: a language model that turns a plain-language task
//! into a flow, and never acts.
//!
//! It is given the task, the flow guide, the *names* of the facts the caller
//! supplied, and which surfaces are available — never a fact's value and
//! never the screen. Its answer is validated with the same checker `RunFlow`
//! uses; an invalid flow goes back to the model with the errors, up to
//! [`REPAIRS`] times. Values the flow needs and no fact supplies come back as
//! questions for the caller.
//!
//! The model is behind [`LanguageModel`], so this logic is tested with
//! scripted answers; the `planner` feature adds the hosted adapter, on
//! `OpenRouter` or Tiny Humans' OpenAI-compatible gateway (`config.rs`,
//! `hosted.rs`).

const PROTOCOL: &str = "You plan tasks for a module that drives web pages and desktop \
applications for a person. You cannot see the screen and you do not know any site's or \
application's interface: you describe what should happen, in plain steps, following the \
guide below. Reply with exactly one JSON object and nothing else: a flow \
({\"app\": ..., \"steps\": [...]}). \
Use `browse` for anything on the web and `open` for a desktop application. \
Refer to the person's details only as ${name} variables: use the fact names you are given, \
and invent a clear name for any other detail the task needs, so the person can be asked for \
it. Never invent personal details. A shared fact may appear in any step's text, so write \
steps the way a person would (\"choose ${title} in the title field\"). A secret fact — a \
card number, a passport number, a password — may appear only as an `enter` step's value: \
it is never shown to the model that runs the steps, so it may not appear in an `open` \
application name, a `browse` address, a `do`, `verify`, `wait_for`, `stop_before`, `choose`, \
`read`, `extract`, `pick`, `repeat_until`, or `if` text, or as an `enter` slot's own name. \
Enter payment details only from secret facts you are given, and end any purchase or \
booking with a stop_before step for paying. Write a variable a step reads as ${name}, \
never bare, so its value is shown. A `verify` or `wait_for` must be checkable on the \
current screen alone: never compare with another site or an earlier page, since `pick` \
already ranks, and never name a `pick` variable in a `verify`, `wait_for`, `repeat_until`, \
or `if` condition: it holds the whole item's text, and a pick already fails when nothing \
fits. A `choose` option is the label the page shows for it (\"Saver\"), never \
a description (\"the cheapest fare\"): choosing by a criterion is `pick`. Guard \
sending, deleting, publishing, or submitting with a stop_before step.";
